Future-Ready FDTD Workshop
***************************

The Future-Ready FDTD Workshop Series is a collaborative effort between Tidy3D, iOptics, and Optica. The series aims to present a range of workshops focused on FDTD simulations for photonic devices. The workshop sessions took place from February 9th to March 8th, 2024, and covered theoretical foundations of concepts such as the FDTD method, Bragg filters and reflectors, multimode photonic design, photonic crystals, and inverse design.
Each session included a live demonstration of setting up and running an FDTD simulation. Additionally, a challenge was proposed to enhance participants' skills. Challenge solutions are available upon request through our technical support.
