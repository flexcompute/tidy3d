FDTD 101 is an introduction to the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Electromagnetics. We will walk you through the basics of setting up and running electromagnetic simulations using the FDTD method. Through this course, you will gain a knowledge of the fundamental concepts behind electromagnetic simulation as well as many advanced topics worth considering when you set up your simulations.
