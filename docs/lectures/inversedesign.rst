Inverse design in photonics
***************************

Adjoint optimization is a powerful tool that has gained significant attention in the photonics community. It leverages the adjoint method, a mathematical technique used to calculate gradients or derivatives of performance metrics with respect to design parameters. This method is particularly useful in photonics, where devices often have a large number of design parameters and complex performance metrics. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles and applications of adjoint optimization in the field of photonics.
