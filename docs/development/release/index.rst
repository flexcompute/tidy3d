Release Flow
==============

This page contains all the relevant information relating to each version release process for ``tidy3d``.

.. You just need to make sure that the ``<same>`` branches of both ``tidy3d/`` and ``tidy3d-notebooks/`` repositories within the ``./`` and ``./docs/notebooks/`` directories are updated. The ``readthedocs`` documentation will be automatically updated through the ``sync-readthedocs-repo`` Github action.
