## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [1.9.0] - 2023-3-01

### Added
- Specification of relative permittivity distribution using raw, user-supplied data through a `CustomMedium` component.
- Automatic differentiation through `Tidy3D` simulations using `jax` through `tidy3d.plugins.adjoint`.
- New Drude model variants for Gold and Silver in the `material_library`.
- Plugin `ComplexPolySlab` for supporting complex polyslabs containing self-intersecting polygons during extrusion.
- Asynchronous running of multiple simulations concurrently using `web.run_async`.
- Jax-compatible `run_async` in the `adjoint` plugin for efficiently running multi-simulation objectives concurrently and differentiating result.
- Warning in `Simulation.epsilon` if many grid cells and structures provided and slow run time expected as a result.
- `verbose` option in `tidy3d.web` functions and containers. If `False`, there will be no non-essential output when running simulations over web api.
- Warning if PML or absorbing boundaries are used along a simulation dimension with zero size.

### Changed
- Saving and loading of `.hdf5` files is made orders of magnitude faster due to an internal refactor.
- `PolySlab.from_gds` supports `gds_cell` from both `gdspy` and `gdstk`, both packages are made optional requirements.
- Adjoint plugin `JaxCustomMedium` is made faster and can handle several thousand pixels without significant overhead.
- Jax is made an optional requirement. The adjoint plugin supports jax versions 0.3 and 0.4 for windows and non-windows users, respectively.
- Issue a deprecation warning that `Geometry.intersections` will be renamed to `Geometry.intersections_plane` in 2.0.
- Limit some warnings to only show for the first structure for which they are encountered.
- Billed flex unit no longer shown at the end of `web.run` as it may take a few seconds until it is available. Instead, added a `web.real_cost(task_id)` function to get the cost after a task run.

### Fixed
- Progressbars always set to 100% when webapi functions are finished.
- Faster handling of `Geometry.intersects` and `Geometry.inside` by taking into account geometry bounds.
- Numpy divide by zero warning in mode solver fixed by initializing jacobians as real instead of complex.
- Bug in validators for 2D objects being in homogeneous media which were looking at the infinite plane in which the objects lie. This can also significantly speed up some validators in the case of many structures.
- Sources and monitors with bend radii are displayed with curved arrows.

## [1.8.4] - 2023-2-13

### Fixed
- Error importing `Axes` type with most recent `matplotlib` release (3.7).

## [1.8.3] - 2023-1-26

### Fixed
- Bug in `Simulation.epsilon` with `coord_key="centers"` in which structures were not rendered.
- Missing `@functools.wrap` in `ensure_freq_in_range` decorator from `medium.py` causing incorrect docstrings.

## [1.8.2] - 2023-1-12

### Added
- Warning if users install via `tidy3d-beta` on pip, from now on, best to use `tidy3d` directly.
- Support for dispersive media in `AnisotropicMedium`

### Changed
- Support shapely version >=2.0 for all python versions.
- Internally refactor `Simulation.epsilon` and move `eps_diagonal` to `Structure` in preparation for future changes.
- Readme displays updated instructions for installing tidy3d (remove beta version mention).

### Fixed
- Field decay warning in mode solver when symmetry present.
- Formatting bug in Tidy3d custom exceptions.

### Removed

## [1.8.1] - 2022-12-30

### Added
- Environment variable `TIDY3D_SSL_VERIFY` to optionally disable SSL authentication (default is `True`).
- Billed FlexUnit cost displayed at the end of `web.monitor`.

### Fixed
- Bug on Windows systems with submitting `CustomFieldSource` data to the server.
- Fix to `FieldData.symmetry_expanded_copy` for monitors with `colocate=True`.

### Changed
- The `Simulation` version updater is called every time a `Simulation` object is loaded, not just `from_file`.
- Boundary specifications that rely on the default `Periodic` boundary now print a deprecation warning, as the default boundaries will change to
 `PML` in Tidy3D 2.0. 

## [1.8.0] - 2022-12-14

### Added
- `CustomFieldSource` that can inject arbitrary source fields.
- `ElectromagneticFieldData.flux` property for data corresponding to 2D monitors, and `ElectromagneticFieldData.dot`
method for computing the overlap integral over two sets of frequency-domain field data.
- Data corresponding to 2D `FieldMonitor` and `FieldTimeMonitor`, as well as to `ModeSolverMonitor`, now also stores `grid_correction` data
 related to the finite grid along the normal direction. This needs to be taken into account to avoid e.g. numerical oscillations of the flux
 with the exact position of the monitor that is due to the interpolation from the grid cell boundaries. These corrections are automatically
 applied when using the `flux` and `dot` methods.
- Resonance finding plugin for estimating resonance frequency and Q-factor of multiple resonances from time-domain data.
 Accessed through `tidy3d.plugins.ResonanceFinder`.
- New `.updated_copy(**kwargs)` method to all tidy3d objects to add a more convenient shortcut to copying an instance with updated fields, 
 i.e. `med.copy(update=dict(permittivity=3.0))` becomes `med.updated_copy(permittivity=3.0)`.
- Test support for python 3.11.
- `sidewall_angle` option for `Cylinder` that allows a `Cylinder` to be tuned into a conical frustum or a cone.
- `reference_plane` for `PolySlab` that provides options to define the vertices at the bottom, middle, or top of the `PolySlab`.
- Automesh generation: `MeshOverrideStructure` that allows for a direct grid size specification in override structures,
 and `dl_min` that bounds the minimal grid size.
- More material models to the material database such as gold from Olman2012.
- In `AdvancedFitterParam` for `StableDispersionFitter`, `random_seed` option to set the random seed,
 and `bound_f_lower` to set the lower bound of pole frequency.
- Introduced the option to project fields at near, intermediate, and far distances using an exact Green's function formalism which does not
 make far-field approximations. This can be enabled in any `AbstractFieldProjectionMonitor` by setting `far_field_approx=False`. A tutorial notebook
 as a comprehensive reference for field projections was added to the documentation.
- Tracking of modes in `ModeSolverData` based on overlap values, controlled through `ModeSpec.track_freq`.
- Native broadband support for `GassuainBeam` `AstigmaticGaussianBeam`, and `ModeSource` through the `num_freqs` argument.
- Apodization option for frequency-domain monitors to ignore temporal data in the beginning and/or end of a simulation


### Changed
- Minimum flex unit charge reduced from `0.1` to `0.025`.
- Default courant factor was changed from `0.9` to `0.99`.
- A point dipole source placed on a symmetry plane now always has twice the amplitude of the same source in a simulation without the 
 symmetry plane, as expected by continuity with the case when the dipole is slightly off the symmetry plane, in which case 
 there are effectively two dipoles, the original one and its mirror image. Previously, the amplitude was only doubled for dipoles polarized normal 
 to the plane, because of Yee grid specifics.
- `FluxMonitor` and `FluxTimeMonitor` no longer snap fields to centers, but instead provide continuous interpolation of the flux over the
 exact geometry of the monitor.
- Major refactor to internal handling of data structures, including pure `Dataset` components that do not depend on other `Tidy3D` components and may
 therefore be used to define custom data in `Tidy3D` models.
- Speed and memory usage improvement when writing and reading Tidy3d models to and from `.hdf5` files.
- Writing `Tidy3D` models containing custom data to `.json` file will log a warning and exclude the raw data from the file for performance reasons.
- Material database reorganization and fixing a few references to the dispersion data.
- The name `Near2Far` has been replaced with `FieldProjection`. For example, `Near2FarAngleMonitor` is now `FieldProjectionAngleMonitor`.
- The API for far field projections has been simplified and several methods have now become properties. 
 For example, the radar cross section is now accessed as `.radar_cross_section`, not `.radar_cross_section()`.
- Added a method `renormalize_fields` to `AbstractFieldProjectionData` to re-project far fields to different projection distances.
- The API for `DiffractionData` was refactored to unify it with the API for `AbstractFieldProjectionData`.
- The user no longer needs to supply `orders_x` and `orders_y` when creating a `DiffractionMonitor`; all allowed orders are automatically
generated and returned in the resulting `DiffractionData`.
- The user no longer needs to supply a `medium` when creating a `DiffractionMonitor` or any `AbstractFieldProjectionMonitor`; the medium through
which fields are to be projected is now determined automatically based on the medium in which the monitor is placed.
- The following attributes of `AbstractFieldProjectionMonitor` are now properties rather than methods:
`fields_spherical`, `fields_cartesian`, `power`, `radar_cross_section`.


### Fixed
- Some issues in `DiffractionMonitor` that is not `z`-normal that could lead to solver errors or wrong results.
- Bug leading to solver error when `Absorber` boundaries with `num_layers = 0` are used.
- Bug leading to solver error when a `FieldMonitor` crosses a `BlochBoundary` and not all field components are recorded.
- When running a `Batch`, `path_dir` is created if not existing.
- Ignore shapely `STRtree` deprecation warning.
- Ignore x axis when plotting 1D `Simulation` cross sections to avoid plot irregularities.
- Local web api tests.
- Use Tidy3D logger for some warnings that used to use default python logging.
 
### Changed

### Added
- `DiffractionMonitor` to compute the power amplitude distribution in all diffraction orders in simulations of periodic structures.
- `PolySlab` can be oriented along `x` or `y`, not just `z`.

### Removed

## [1.6.3] - 2022-9-13

### Added
- Type field for `DataArray` subclasses written to `hdf5`.

### Fixed
- Bug in 3D `Near2Far` monitors where surfaces defined in `exclude_surfaces` will no actually be excluded.
- Bug in getting angles from `k`-space values in `Near2FarKSpaceMonitor`.

- Option to load base models without validation.
- Support negative sidewall angle for slanted `PolySlab`-s.
- Option to specify only a subset of the S-matrix to compute in the S-matrix plugin, as well as to provide mapping between elements (due to symmetries).
- More Lorentz-Drude material models to the material database.

### Fixed
- Raise a more meaningful error if login failed after `MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
- Environment login credentials set to `""` are now ignored and credentials stored to file are still looked for.
- Improved subpixel coefficients computation around sharp edges, cornes, and three-structure intersections.

### Changed
- Major refactor of the way data structures are used internally.
- `ModeFieldMonitor` -> `ModeSolerMonitor` with associated `ModeSolverData`. `ModeSolverData` is now also stored internally in `ModeSolver`, 
 and the `plot_field` method can be called directly from `ModeSolver` instead of `ModeSolverData`.
- Field data for monitors that have a zero size along a given dimension is now interpolated to the exact `monitor.center` along that dimension.
- Removed `nlopt` from requirements, user-side material fitting now uses `scipy`.
- New Field `normalize_index` in `Simulation` - used to be input parameter when loading simulation data. A given `SimulationData` 
 can still be renormalized to a different source later on using the new `SimulationData.renormalize`.
- `FluxMonitor` and `FluxTimeMonitor`-s can now have a 3D box geometry, in which case the flux going out of all box surfaces is computed (optionally, 
 some surfaces can be excluded).
- Frequency-domain monitors require a non-empty list of frequencies.
- Reduced the minimum flex unit cost to run a simulation to `0.1`.
- Reduced the premium cost for dispersive materials in typical cases.
- Added a cost for monitors that should be negligible in typical cases but affects large monitors that significantly slow down the simulation.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-7-21

### Fixed
- Bug in computing the `bounds` of `GeometryGroup`.
- Bug in auto-mesh generation.

- Ability to compute far fields server-side on GPUs.

### Changed
- All Tidy3D components apart from data structures are now fully immutable.
- Stopped support for python 3.6, improved support for python 3.10.
- Web material fitter for lossless input data (no `k` data provided) will now return a lossless medium.
- `sort_by` changed to `filter_pol` in `ModeSpec`.
- `center` no longer a field of all `Geometry` components, instead only present when needed, 
 removed in `PolySlab` and `GeometryGroup`. `Planar` geometries no longer have a mandatory `length` field, but 
 have `center_axis` and `lengt_axis` properties for the center and length along the extrusion axis. `PolySlab` now defined exclusively through `slab_bounds`, 
 while `Cylinder` through `center` and `length`.
- In mode solver, allow precision to switch between double and single precision.
- Near-to-far transformation tool is no longer a plugin, but is now part of Tidy3D's new core data structures


## [1.4.1] - 2022-6-13

- Throw warning if user tries to download data instances in `yaml` or `json` format. 
- Arrow length plotting issues for infinite sources.
- Issues with nonuniform mesh not extending exactly to simulation boundaries.

### Added
- Bloch periodic boundary conditions, enabling modeling of angled plane wave.
- `GeometryGroup` object to associate several `Geometry` intances in a single `Structure` leading to improved performance for many objects.
- Ability to uniquely specify boundary conditions on all 6 `Simulation` boundaries.
- Options in field montitors for spatial downsampling and evaluation at yee grid centers.
- `BatchData.load()` can load the data for a batch directly from a directory.
- Utility for updating `Simulation` objects from old versions of `Tidy3d` to current version.
- Explicit `web.` functions for downloading only `simulation.json` and `tidy3d.log` files.

### Changed
- `Batch` objects automatically download their json file upon `download` and `load`.
- Uses `shapely` instead of `gdspy` to merge polygons from a gds cell.
- `ComponentModeler` (S matrix tool) stores the `Batch` rather than the `BatchData`.
- Custom caching of properties to speed up subsequent calculations.
- Tidy3d configuration now done through setting attributes of `tidy3d.config` object.

## [1.3.3] - 2022-5-18

### Fixed

 - Bug in `Cylinder.inside` when `axis != 2`.

### Added

 - `AstigmaticGaussianBeam` source.

### Changed

 - Internal functions that may require hashing the simulation many times now use a `make_static` decorator. This pre-computes the simulation hash and stores it,
 and makes sure that the simulation has not changed at the beginning and end of the function execution.
 - Speeding up initialization of `PolySlab` when there is no dilation or slant angle.
 - Allow customizing data range that colormap covers in `plot_field`.
 - Speeding up of the automatic grid generation using Rtree and other improvements.
 - Better handling of http response errors.
 - In `web.monitor`, the estimated cost is only displayed when available; avoid "Unable to get cost" warning.
 - In `PolySlab.from_gds`, the selected polygons are first merged if possible, before the `PolySlab`-s are made. This avoids bugs e.g. in the case of slanted walls.

## [1.3.2] - 2022-4-30

### Fixed

 - Bug in nonuniform mesh where the simulation background medium may be taken into account if higher than other structures overriding it.

## [1.3.1] - 2022-4-29

### Added

### Changed

 - Maximum allowed number of distinct materials is now 65530.

### Fixed

 - Monitor/source opacity values also applied to associated arrows.
 - Auto meshing in the presence of symmetries ignores anything outside of the main symmetry quadrant.
 - If an interface is completely covered by another structure, it is ignored by the mesher.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-4-26

### Added

- New `grid_spec` Field in `Simulation` that allows more flexibility in defining the mesh.
- `GridSpec1d` class defining how the meshing along each dimension should be done, with sublcasses `UniformGrid` and `CustomGrid` that cover the functionality 
  previously offered by supplying a float or a list of floats to `Simulation.grid_size`. New functionality offered by `AutoGrid` subclass, with the 
  mesh automatically generated based on the minimum required steps per wavelength.
- New `PointDipole` source.
- Opacity kwargs for monitor and source in `sim.plot`.
- Separated `plotly`-based requirements from core requrements file, can be added with `"pip install tidy3d-beta[plotly]"`.

### Changed
- `Simulation.grid_spec` uses the default `GridSpec`, which has `AutoGrid(min_steps_per_wvl=10)` in each direction. To initialize a `Simulation` then it is no 
  longer needed to provide grid information, if sources are added to the simulation. Otherwise an error will be raised asking to provide a wavelength for the auto mesh.
- `VolumeSource` is now called `UniformCurrentSource`.
- S-matrix module now places the monitors exactly at the port locations and offsets the source slightly for numerical reasons (more accurate).
- Fixed bug in `PolySlab` visualization with sidewalls.
- Inheritance structure of `Source` reorganized.
- Better handling of only one `td.inf` in `Box.from_bounds`.
- Added proper label to intensity plots.

- `SimulationPlotly` interface for generating `Simulation.plot()` figures using `plotly` instead of `matplotlib`.
- New `PermittivityMonitor` and `PermittivityData` to store the complex relative permittivity as used in the simulation.
- The maximum credit cost for a simulation can now be queried using `web.estimate_cost`. It is also displayed by default during `web.upload`.

### Changed
- Faster plotting for matplotlib and plotly.
- `SimulationData` normalization keeps track of source index and can be normalized when loading directly from .hdf5 file.
- Monitor data with symmetries now store the minimum required data to file and expands the symmetries on the fly.
- Significant speedup in plotting complicated simulations without patch transparency.
- When a list of `dl` is provided as a `grid_size` along a given direction, the grid is placed such that the total size `np.sum(dl)` is centered at the simulation center.
  Previously, a grid boundary was always placed at the simulation center.

## [1.2.1] - 2022-3-30

### Added

- Reorganized some of the internal `Source` classes.
- Major improvements to `Batch` objects. `Batch.run()` returns a `BatchData` object that maps `task_name` to `SimulationData`.
- Infinity stored as `str` in json outputs, conforming to json file specifications.
- No longer need to specify one of `x/y/z` in `SimulationData.plot_field` if the monitor has a zero-sized dimension.

- Fixed bug in unpacking monitor fields with symmetries and ``interpolate=False``.
- Lots of streamlining on the backend side.

### 21.4.1

### 21.3.1.5
 - Frequency monitors can now optionally store the complex permittivity at the same locations where 
   the E-fields are recorded, at the monitor frequencies.
 - Frequency monitors now also have an `'interpolate'` keyword, which defaults to `True` and 
   reproduces the behavior of previous versions. If set to `False`, however, the raw fields 
   evaluated at their corresponding Yee grid locations are returned, instead of the fields interpolated 
   to the Yee cell centers. This also affects the returned permittivity, if requested.

- Rehashed error handling to output more runtime errors to tidy3d.log.
- Job and Batch classes for better simulation handling (eventually to fully replace webapi functions).
- A large number of small improvements and bug fixes.
