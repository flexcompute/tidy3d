    Notes
    -----

        :class:`FieldMonitor` objects operate by running a discrete Fourier transform of the fields at a given set of
        frequencies to perform the calculation “in-place” with the time stepping. :class:`FieldMonitor`  objects are
        useful for investigating the steady-state field distribution in 2D and 3D regions of the simulation.

    Example
    -------

    ...     size=(2,2,2),

class FieldTimeMonitor(AbstractFieldMonitor, TimeMonitor):

    Notes
    -----

        :class:`FieldTimeMonitor` objects are best used to monitor the time dependence of the fields at a single
        point, but they can also be used to create “animations” of the field pattern evolution.

        To create an animation, we need to capture the frames at different time instances of the simulation. This can
        be done by using a :class:`FieldTimeMonitor`. Usually a FDTD simulation contains a large number of time steps
        and grid points. Recording the field at every time step and grid point will result in a large dataset. For
        the purpose of making animations, this is usually unnecessary.


    Example
    -------
    >>> monitor = FieldTimeMonitor(
    ...     center=(1,2,3),
    ...     size=(2,2,2),
    ...     fields=['Hx'],

class FieldProjectionAngleMonitor(AbstractFieldProjectionMonitor):
    """:class:`Monitor` that samples electromagnetic near fields in the frequency domain
    and projects them at given observation angles.

    Notes
    -----

        .. TODO this needs an illustration

        **Parameters Caveats**

        The :attr:`center` and :attr:`size` parameters define
        where the monitor will be placed in order to record near fields, typically very close
        to the structure of interest. The near fields are then projected
        to far-field locations defined by :attr:`phi`, :attr:`theta`, and :attr:`proj_distance`, relative
        to the :attr:`custom_origin`.

        **Usage Caveats**

        The field projections make use of the analytical homogeneous medium Green’s function, which assumes that the
        fields are propagating in a homogeneous medium. Therefore, one should use :class:`PML` / :class:`Absorber` as
        boundary conditions in the part of the domain where fields are projected.

        .. TODO why not add equation here

        Server-side field projections will add to the monetary cost of the simulation. However, typically the far field
        projections have a very small computation cost compared to the FDTD simulation itself, so the increase in monetary
        cost should be negligibly small in most cases. For applications where the monitor is an open surface rather than a box that
        encloses the device, it is advisable to pick the size of the monitor such that the
        recorded near fields decay to negligible values near the edges of the monitor.

        .. TODO TYPO FIX o that the approximations are not used, and the projection is accurate even just a few wavelengths away from the near field locations.

        By default, if no :attr:`proj_distance` was provided, the fields are projected to a distance of 1m.

        **Server-side field projection Application**

        Provide the :class:`FieldProjectionAngleMonitor` monitor as an input to the
        :class:`Simulation` object as one of its monitors. Now, we no longer need to provide a separate near-field
        :class:`FieldMonitor` - the near fields will automatically be recorded based on the size and location of the
        ``FieldProjectionAngleMonitor``. Note also that in some cases, the server-side computations may be slightly
        more accurate than client-side ones, because on the server, the near fields are not downsampled at all.

        We can re-project the already-computed far fields to a different distance away from the structure - we
        neither need to run another simulation nor re-run the :class:`FieldProjector`.

        **Far-Field Approximation Selection**

        .. TODO unsure if add on params?

        If the distance between the near and far field locations is
        much larger than the size of the device, one can typically set :attr:`far_field_approx` to
        ``True``, which will make use of the far-field approximation to speed up calculations.
        If the projection distance is comparable to the size of the device, we recommend setting
        :attr:`far_field_approx` to ``False``.

        .. image:: ../../notebooks/img/n2f_diagram.png

        .. TODO Fix that image so remove right irrelevant side

        When selected, it is assumed that:

        -   The fields are measured at a distance much greater than the size of our simulation in the transverse
            direction.
        -   The geometric approximations imply that any quantity whose magnitude drops off as
            :math:`\\frac{1}{r^2}` or faster is ignored.

        The advantages of these approximations are:

        *   The projections are computed relatively fast.
        *   The projections are cast in a simple mathematical form.
            which allows re-projecting the fields to different distance without the need to re-run a simulation or to

    Notes

        **Parameters Caveats**

        The :attr:`center` and :attr:`size` fields define
        where the monitor will be placed in order to record near fields, typically very close
        to the structure of interest. The near fields are then projected
        to far-field locations defined by :attr:`x`, :attr:`y`, and :attr:`proj_distance`, relative
        to the :attr:`custom_origin`.

        Here, :attr:`x` and :attr:`y`, correspond to a local coordinate system
        where the local ``z`` axis is defined by :attr:`proj_axis`: which is the axis normal to this monitor.

        **Far-Field Approximation Selection**

        If the distance between the near and far field locations is much larger than the size of the
        device, one can typically set :attr:`far_field_approx` to ``True``, which will make use of the
        far-field approximation to speed up calculations. If the projection distance is comparable
        to the size of the device, we recommend setting :attr:`far_field_approx` to ``False``,
        so that the approximations are not used, and the projection is accurate even just a few
        wavelengths away from the near field locations.

        For applications where the monitor is an open surface rather than a box that
        encloses the device, it is advisable to pick the size of the monitor such that the
        recorded near fields decay to negligible values near the edges of the monitor.

        .. image:: ../../notebooks/img/n2f_diagram.png

        .. TODO unsure if add on params?

        When selected, it is assumed that:

        -   The fields are measured at a distance much greater than the size of our simulation in the transverse
            direction.
        -   The geometric approximations imply that any quantity whose magnitude drops off as
            :math:`\\frac{1}{r^2}` or faster is ignored.

        The advantages of these approximations are:

        *   The projections are computed relatively fast.
        *   The projections are cast in a simple mathematical form.
            which allows re-projecting the fields to different distance without the need to re-run a simulation or to
            re-run the :class:`FieldProjector`.


        In cases where we may want to project to intermediate distances where the far field approximation is no
        longer valid, simply include the class definition parameter ``far_field_approx=False`` in the
        ``FieldProjectionCartesianMonitor`` instantiation. The resulting computations will be a bit slower,
        but the results will be significantly more accurate.

        .. TODO include this example

        **Usage Caveats**

        .. TODO I believe a little illustration here would be handy.

        Since field projections rely on the surface equivalence principle, we have assumed that the tangential near
        fields recorded on the near field monitor serve as equivalent sources which generate the correct far fields.
        However, this requires that the field strength decays nearly to zero near the edges of the near-field
        monitor, which may not always be the case. For example, if we had used a larger aperture compared to the full
        simulation size in the transverse direction, we may expect a degradation in accuracy of the field
        projections. Despite this limitation, the field projections are still remarkably accurate in realistic
        scenarios. For realistic case studies further demonstrating the accuracy of the field projections,
        see our metalens and zone plate case studies.

        The field projections make use of the analytical homogeneous medium Green’s function, which assumes that the fields
        are propagating in a homogeneous medium. Therefore, one should use PMLs / absorbers as boundary conditions in the
        part of the domain where fields are projected. For far field projections in the context of perdiodic boundary
        conditions, see the diffraction efficiency example which demonstrates the use of a DiffractionMonitor.

        Server-side field projections will add to the monetary cost of the simulation. However, typically the far field
        projections have a very small computation cost compared to the FDTD simulation itself, so the increase in monetary
        cost should be negligibly small in most cases.
