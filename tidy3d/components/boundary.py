        **1D Model Illustration**

        Consider a transformed wave equation in the :math:`x` dimension below _`[1]`:

        .. math::

             \\left( \\left( \\frac{1}{s(x)} \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta x} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta t^2} \\right) E = 0

        where the wave stretch factor :math:`s(x)` depends on the PML boundary position in the :math:`x` dimension.

        .. TODO what is x at 0?

        .. math::

             s(x) = \\left \\{
                        \\begin{array}{lr}
                            1, & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\
                            1 - \\frac{\\sigma}{i \\omega \\epsilon_0}, & \\text{for } x > 0
                        \\end{array}
                    \\right \\}

        The wave equation can be solved and plotted accordingly as a function of the :math:`x` dimension.

        .. math::

             E(x) = \\left \\{
                        \\begin{array}{lr}
                            e^{i(kx - \\omega t)}, & \\text{for } x < 0 \\\\
                            e^{i(kx - \\omega t)} \\times e^{-\\frac{\\sigma x}{c \\epsilon_0}} & \\text{for } x > 0
                        \\end{array}
                    \\right \\}

        Hence, we see how this PML stretch factor induces frequency-independent exponential attentation and no
        reflection after the boundary at :math:`x=0`.

        **Usage Caveats**

        A perfectly matched layer (PML) is the most commonly used boundary condition in FDTD simulations to truncate
        a simulation domain and absorb outgoing radiation. However, many divergence issues are associated with the
        use of PML. One of the most common causes of a diverged simulation is structures inserted into PML at an angle.

        .. TODO links to absorber boundaries

        .. image:: ../../notebooks/img/diverged-fdtd-simulation.png

        Incorporating a dispersive material into the PML can also cause simulation divergence in certain scenarios.
        If your simulation lacks any structures inserted into the PML at an angle, but includes dispersive material
        in PML, it is advisable to substitute a nondispersive material for the dispersive material. Alternatively,
        if dispersion is necessary, switching from the :class:`PML` to :class:`Absorber` can effectively address the
        issue.

        The PML can effectively absorb outgoing radiation with minimum reflection as if the radiation just propagates
        into the free space. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the PML only absorbs propagating fields. For
        evanescent fields, the PML can act as an amplification medium and cause a simulation to diverge. In Tidy3D,
        a warning will appear if the distance between a structure is smaller than half of a wavelength to prevent
        evanescent fields from leaking into PML. In most cases, the evanescent field will naturally die off within
        half a wavelength, but in some instances, a larger distance may be required.

        This absorber is well-suited for dispersive materials intersecting with absorbing edges of the simulation at the
        expense of more layers.

        **Usage Caveats**

        Using absorber boundary is often a good remedy to resolve divergence issues related to :class:`PML`. The
        adiabatic absorber is a multilayer system with gradually increasing conductivity. The absorber usually has a
        larger undesired reflection compared to :class:`PML`. In practice, this small difference rarely matters,
        but is important to understand for simulations that require high accuracy.

        There are two possible sources for the reflection from absorbers. The first, and more common one, is that the
        ramping up of the conductivity is not sufficiently slow, which can be remedied by increasing the number of
        absorber layers (40 by default). The second one is that the absorption is not high enough, such that the
        light reaches the :class:`PEC` boundary at the end of the :class:`Absorber`, travels back through it,
        and is still not fully attenuated before re-entering the simulation region. If this is the case, increasing
        the maximum conductivity :class:`AbsorberParams` can help. In both cases, changing the order of the scaling
        of the conductivity (:attr:`tidy3d.AbsorberParams.sigma_order`) can also have an effect, but this is a more
        advanced setting that we typically do not recommend modifying.

class BoundarySpec(Tidy3dBaseModel):

    Specifies boundary conditions on each side of the domain and along each dimension.

    Notes
    -----

        This :class:`BoundarySpec` object defines the boundary conditions applied on each of the 6 domain edges,
        and is provided as an input to the simulation.

        A :class:`BoundarySpec` consists of three :class:`Boundary` objects, each defining the boundaries on the plus
        and minus side of each dimension. In most cases, one just wants to specify whether there are absorbing
        :class:`PML` layers along any of the ``x``, ``y``, ``z`` dimensions. By default, ``tidy3d`` simulations have
        :class:`PML` boundaries on all sides.

        If we want to explicitly set the boundaries, we can use the :attr:`tidy3d.BoundarySpec.all_sides` method.
        This can be used to set any type of boundary condition on all sides of the simulation. We can also set
        :class:`PML` on specified sides only by calling the :attr:`tidy3d.BoundarySpec.pml` method, e.g. ``BoundarySpec.pml(
        x=False, y=False, z=False)``. This will put :class:`PML` along the dimensions defined as ``True``,
        and set periodic boundaries along the other dimensions.
