class ErosionDilationPenalty(AbstractPenalty):

    Uses filtering and projection methods to erode and dilate the features within this array.
    Measures the change in the array after eroding and dilating (and also dilating and eroding).
    Returns a penalty proportional to the magnitude of this change.
    The amount of change under dilation and erosion is minimized if the structure has large feature
    sizes and large radius of curvature relative to the length scale.
