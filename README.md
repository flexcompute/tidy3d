## Flow


### Client (Pre)

- Make `tidy3d.components` to define simulation.
	- Using builtin `tidy3d` imports (`td.PlaneWave`, `td.ModeMonitor`, etc.)
	- Using `tidy3d.plugins` to construct more specialized components (mode solver, dispersion fitter, etc.).
- Create a `td.Simulation` object containing all simulation parameters (pydantic will automatically validate all components).
- Upload `Simulation` to server using `tidy3d.web`.
	- Export `Simulation` to a .json file format with `Simulation.json()`
	- Save as .json file.
	- Upload to server using http request, authenticate, etc.
	- Use `plugins.batch_processor` to submit batches of simulations.
- Manage task with `tidy3d.web`
	- Run task explicitly (if draft).
	- Monitor progress.
	- Cancel / delete task.
- load results into `td.SimulationData` object, containing simulation and data for all of its monitors.
	- Look at log through `sim_data.log`.
	- Plot data.
	- Manipulate, interpolte, resample data.
