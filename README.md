## Flow


### Client (Pre)

- Make `tidy3d.components` to define simulation.
	- Using builtin `tidy3d` imports (`td.PlaneWave`, `td.ModeMonitor`, etc.)
	- Using `tidy3d.plugins` to construct more specialized components (mode solver, dispersion fitter, etc.).
- Create a `td.Simulation` object containing all simulation parameters (pydantic will automaticall validate all components).
- Upload `Simulation` to server using `tidy3d.web`.
	- Export `Simulation` to a .json file format with `Simulation.json()`
	- Save as .json file.
	- Upload to server using http request, authenticate, etc.
	- Use `plugins.batch_processor` to submit batches of simulations.
- Manage task with `tidy3d.web`
	- Run task explicitly (if draft).
	- Monitor progress.
	- Cancel / delete task.

### Core

- Validate received .json file using `Simulation` schema file from our local copy of client.
- Load `.json` into `Simulation` object using local copy of client.
- Preprocess `Simulation` into files needed for core solver (need momchil's help).
- Run solver, export solver data files (need momchil's help).
- Postprocess solver data files into `SimulationData` containing `MonitorData` using definitions from local copy of client (need momchil's help).
- Export data file visualizations as .html to display on browser.
- Store data objects as .hdf5 files on server for download.

### Client (Post)

- Monitor solver progress, manage tasks.
- Load results into `SimulationData` and `MonitorData` objects locally.
	- Download .hdf5 files locally.
	- Open .hdf5 files as `SimulationData` and `MonitorData`.
- Visualize / post process results
	- data management using `xarray.DataArray` operations like `.sel()`, `.iterpolate()`.
	- simple plots with `MonitorData.plot()`
	- interactive plots with `MonitorData.visualize()` 
	- plugins for `near2far`, spectral analysis.

---

#### Momchil's To Do Notes
- [ ] Front end
	- [ ] More discussion in Simulation docs.
	- [ ] Courant 0.99 stable? Adjust range of acceptable values.
	- [ ] Support nonuniform coordinates.
	- [ ] specifying `times` directly probably not very useful, need some conveneience functions.
	- [ ] Support Medium names eventually.
	- [ ] Support diagonal anisotropy.
	- [ ] GDS slab import (+shapely import).
	- [ ] If using "polarization" kwarg, specify 'J' or 'E' in source?.
- [ ] Conversion
	- [ ] Find proper way to link tidy3d and tidy3d core. (core imports local copy of Simulation always updated and on main branch by default?).
	- [ ] Convert dispersive models to PoleResidue.
	- [ ] Support plane wave, gaussian beam, modesource in JSON conversion.
	- [ ] Support mode monitor, permittivity monitor in JSON conversion.	
- [ ] Data
	- [ ] Provide optional args to only export the `MonitorData` of selected `Monitor`s.
	- [ ] Wrap string conversion in MonitorLoad in helper function.
	- [ ] Assert SimulationData's monitor names exist in original Simulation.
	- [ ] Solver field data evaluated at yee cell locations, sufficient to interpolate values anywhere in monitor volume.
	- [ ] Eliminate need for storing `monitor_name` in `MonitorData`.
